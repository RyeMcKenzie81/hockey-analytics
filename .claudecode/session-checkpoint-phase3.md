# Session Checkpoint - 2025-08-30 Phase 3 ML Detection

## What We Were Working On
- Feature: ML Detection Pipeline for Hockey Events
- Phase: 3 - ML Detection & Analysis
- Branch: phase-3-ml-detection

## Last Completed Step
- Fixed NoneType errors in ML processing (missing FPS and duration)
- Added comprehensive logging throughout pipeline
- Fixed database RLS issues with events table
- Model successfully downloaded (YOLOv8x cached)

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Database migration applied (RLS fixed)
- ‚úÖ YOLOv8x model downloaded and cached
- ‚úÖ Fixed validation errors (UUID format)
- ‚úÖ Fixed FPS/duration metadata issues
- ‚è≥ Waiting for deployment of latest fixes
- üîÑ Ready to process 1:03 video once deployed

## Next Steps (for new session)
1. Verify ML processing works end-to-end after deployment
2. Check if events are created in database
3. Verify events appear on frontend timeline
4. Add event visualization improvements
5. Consider switching to lighter model (YOLOv8s) for faster processing
6. Add progress indicator for ML processing
7. Implement Gemini enhancement (if API key set)

## Current Issues/Blockers
- Video metadata missing FPS and duration (using defaults: 30fps, 60s)
- Processing takes long on CPU (~1-2 minutes for 1 minute video)
- Error storing failed events (constraint violation on detection_method)

## Files Being Modified
- `backend/app/routes/ml_processing.py` - ML API endpoints
- `backend/app/services/ml_detector.py` - YOLO detection logic
- `backend/app/services/gemini_analyzer.py` - Gemini enhancement
- `frontend/src/app/games/[id]/page.tsx` - ML trigger button

## Important Context
- Video ID being tested: `96dd335b-4cbd-4860-a95d-67d9d7d9f5dc`
- Processing uses default org_id: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`
- YOLOv8x model cached at: `/root/.cache/ultralytics/`
- Using generic person detection (no hockey-specific model yet)
- Railway deployment takes ~2-3 minutes for backend changes

## SQL to Check Results
```sql
-- Check for any events
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_events,
       COUNT(DISTINCT event_type) as event_types,
       MIN(timestamp_seconds) as first_event,
       MAX(timestamp_seconds) as last_event
FROM events 
WHERE video_id = '96dd335b-4cbd-4860-a95d-67d9d7d9f5dc';

-- See actual events
SELECT event_type, timestamp_seconds, confidence_score, detection_method
FROM events
WHERE video_id = '96dd335b-4cbd-4860-a95d-67d9d7d9f5dc'
ORDER BY timestamp_seconds;
```

## Commands to Run on Resume
```bash
cd ~/projects/hockeyVizion/backend
source venv/bin/activate
git pull origin phase-3-ml-detection

# Test locally if needed
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Check deployment status
git log --oneline -5
```

## Expected Behavior Once Working
1. Click "Detect Events with AI" button
2. Button shows spinner for ~1 minute
3. Events appear on timeline
4. Events stored in database with confidence scores
5. Can click events to jump to timestamps
6. Can verify/reject events

## Performance Notes
- First run: Model download takes 1-2 minutes (already done)
- Subsequent runs: ~30-60 seconds for 1 minute video
- CPU processing is slow, GPU would be 5-10x faster
- Consider YOLOv8s for 3x faster processing with slight accuracy loss
