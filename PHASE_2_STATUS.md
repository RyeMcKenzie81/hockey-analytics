# Hockey Analytics Phase 2 - Status Summary

## Project Overview
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 15 (frontend), FastAPI (backend), Supabase (storage/DB), Railway (deployment)
- **Current Branch**: phase-2-production
- **Backend URL**: https://hockey-analytics-production.up.railway.app
- **Frontend URL**: https://frontend-production-2b5b.up.railway.app

## Phase 2 Completion Status

### ✅ COMPLETED
1. **Video Upload System**
   - Chunked upload for large files (up to 5GB)
   - Progress tracking during upload
   - Handles files >50MB by keeping them chunked

2. **HLS Video Processing**
   - FFmpeg integration via Docker
   - Multi-quality streaming (1080p, 720p, 480p)
   - Proper 10-second HLS segments (FIXED)
   - Background processing with progress tracking

3. **Video Streaming**
   - HLS.js integration
   - Adaptive bitrate streaming
   - Segment loading works correctly

4. **WebSocket Updates**
   - Real-time processing status
   - Proper status tracking (processing → processed)
   - Auto-disconnect when processing complete

5. **Database Schema**
   - Videos table with metadata
   - Status tracking (uploaded → processing → processed/failed)

### ⚠️ REMAINING ISSUE
**Video Player Re-initialization**
- Player restarts after ~1 second of playback
- VideoPlayer useEffect triggers 4-6 times during playback
- "Media attached successfully" appears multiple times
- HLS segments load correctly (10 seconds each)

## Key Files Modified

### Backend
- `/backend/app/services/video_processor.py` - HLS generation with FFmpeg
- `/backend/app/routes/videos.py` - WebSocket and upload endpoints
- `/backend/app/config.py` - CORS configuration
- `/Dockerfile` - FFmpeg installation

### Frontend  
- `/frontend/src/app/games/[id]/page.tsx` - Video viewing page
- `/frontend/src/components/VideoPlayer.tsx` - HLS player component
- `/frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` - WebSocket connection
- `/frontend/src/components/VeoUploader.tsx` - Chunked upload

## Last Working Video
- ID: `96dd335b-4cbd-4860-a95d-67d9d7d9f5dc`
- Has proper 10-second HLS segments
- Loads and starts playing correctly
- Restarts after ~1 second due to re-render issue

## Debug Findings
1. VideoPlayer useEffect triggers multiple times (should only trigger once)
2. Component re-renders when video starts playing
3. URL ref tracking added but issue persists
4. Time update throttling implemented but didn't fix root cause

## Next Steps for New Context
The core issue is that something triggers a re-render cycle when playback starts. Need to:
1. Find what's causing the parent component to re-render
2. Check if EventTimeline or other siblings are causing issues
3. Consider simplifying VideoPlayer to eliminate dependencies
4. May need to move player state management higher up

# CONTINUATION PROMPT FOR NEW CONTEXT

I'm continuing work on a hockey analytics platform (Phase 2). The video upload and processing pipeline works perfectly - videos upload, get converted to HLS with proper 10-second segments, and load correctly.

**THE PROBLEM**: The video player re-initializes multiple times during playback, causing the video to restart after ~1 second.

**Current behavior** (from console logs):
- VideoPlayer useEffect triggers 2 times on page load ✓
- Video loads and shows properly ✓ 
- When clicking play, it plays for ~1 second
- Then VideoPlayer useEffect triggers 4 more times
- Player re-initializes and video restarts from beginning
- This cycle repeats

**Key files to check**:
- `/frontend/src/components/VideoPlayer.tsx` - Has debug logging showing re-initialization
- `/frontend/src/app/games/[id]/page.tsx` - Parent component that renders VideoPlayer

**What's working**:
- HLS segments are perfect (10 seconds each)
- Backend serves files correctly
- WebSocket updates work
- Video loads and can start playing

**Debug attempts that didn't work**:
- Added URL ref tracking to prevent re-init
- Throttled onTimeUpdate callbacks  
- Added unique key prop to VideoPlayer
- Memoized time update handler

**Theory**: Something in the parent component (`/frontend/src/app/games/[id]/page.tsx`) is causing a re-render when playback starts. This might be related to:
- State updates from other components
- Event handlers triggering re-renders
- React's rendering cycle with refs

Please help me fix this video player re-initialization issue so videos play smoothly without restarting.
